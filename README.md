MavInterfaceLib
===============

An event-driven Java library for interfacing with an embedded controller that speaks MAVLink

The goal of this project is to provide a modern Java interface for the MAVLink controller interface.
This means object-oriented, event-driven code that is easy to extend and use. It also means code
that is well documented so that API docs can be generated. As the project nears completion, I will
add some sample code to this README that should assist the end-user in figuring out how to use this
library.
